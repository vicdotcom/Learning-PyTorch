# PyTorch Fundamentals
This section covers the fundamental building blocks of PyTorch: Tensors.

## Concepts Covered
- What tensors are and their distinction from NumPy arrays.
- Tensor creation for various tensor types:
    - Scalar, Vectors, Matrices, 3D, 4D,.... tensors
    - Random tensors
    - Zeros and Ones tensors
    - Empty tensors
    - Transposing tensors
    - Range of tensors
- Tensor datatypes (float16 vs float32 vs float64)
- Tensor operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, matrix multiplication, division)
- Tensor aggragation (Min, Max, Mean, Sum, , Standard deviation, etc...)
- Tensor manipulation (Reshaping, Viewing, Stacking, Squeezing, Unsqueezing, Permuting tensors)
- Conversion of tensors to and from NumPy
- GPU tensor access
